## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Encrypt Phone Number"

_Language: Ruby_

_Difficulty Rating: Easy_

### Objectives

- **Storing plain text phone numbers is never a good idea!**
- Create a function which takes a phone number as a parameter (`str`) and returns an encrypted phone number which only displays the last 4 numbers.
- Encrypted numbers should become an asterisk, `*`, and the hyphens must remain in their respective places.

> i.e.:
>
> input => `718-867-5309`
>
> output => `***-***-5309`

### Notes

- The input will always be an American country code, without the `+01`.
- The input will always be a 10 digit phone number with conventional conventional dashes.
